The game is played by starting at the start class and clicking on classes until you come across the end class. Each time you will be presented with anywhere between 2 and 10 classes, sometimes even classes that you have clicked on before. During gameplay, there are three buttons avaiable to you: to go back, to make a suggestion (useful feedback for me), and to start a new game with different classes. Please note that the game may seem impossible at times, but know is it always possible to win. There are no loops or dead ends. Good luck!
