# Thesis for BA in Applied Mathematics 

These files comprise my senior project for a BA in Applied Mathematics from Yale College. I created a content-based recommendation system of the Spring 2017 Yale course offerings. After gathering and cleaning the data, I used the Jaccard index to construct similarity scores between all pairs of courses. A threshold was selected to create a network among the courses. That network, along with two other variations, was deployed for exploration on a Shiny application. Users played a game (similar to <i>Wikispeedia</i>) where they were given a starting course and had to navigate along the network in an attempt to reach a given target class. Data collected from gameplay was used to analyze the navigability of the three networks and ultimately create a recomendation system (found at http://ktebbe.shinyapps.io/CourseRec/). 

Included in the repository is a PDF file of my finished project report, various .Rmd files, and one of the five Shiny applications.
